    <img src="https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/rustmission.svg" alt="Packaging status" align="right">
</a>

To install Rustmission, ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed on your system, and then run:

```bash
cargo install rustmission
```

or with Nix ( :heart: [@0x61nas](https://github.com/0x61nas) ):

```bash
nix-shell -p rustmission
```

or with Brew ( :heart: [@aidanaden](https://github.com/aidanaden) ):
```bash
brew install intuis/tap/rustmission
```

## Usage

Run `rustmission` in your terminal to initialize the config and make adjustments as needed. Subsequently, run `rustmission` again. For a list of keybindings, press `?` or `F1`.

## Configuration

Rustmission stores its configuration in a TOML file located at `~/.config/rustmission/config.toml` by default. You can modify this file to
set the daemon's address.

```toml
[general]
# Whether to hide empty columns or not
auto_hide = false

# Possible values: Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Magenta, Cyan.
# Use prefix "Light" for a brighter color.
# It can also be a hex, e.g. "#3cb371"
accent_color = "LightMagenta"

# If enabled, shows various keybindings throughout the program at the cost of
# a little bit cluttered interface.
beginner_mode = true

# If enabled, hides header row of torrents tab
headers_hide = false

[connection]
url = "http://CHANGE_ME:9091/transmission/rpc" # REQUIRED!

# If you need username and password to authenticate:
# username = "CHANGE_ME"
# password = "CHANGE_ME"

# Refresh timings (in seconds)
torrents_refresh = 5
stats_refresh = 10
free_space_refresh = 10
```

There's also a self-documenting keymap config located at `~/.config/rustmission/keymap.toml` with sane defaults.
