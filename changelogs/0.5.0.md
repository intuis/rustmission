# Breaking changes
In `~/.config/rustmission/keymap.toml` under torrents_tab section replace:
```
  { on = "d", action = "DeleteWithoutFiles" },
  { on = "D", action = "DeleteWithFiles" },
```
with:
```
  { on = "d", action = "Delete"},
```

This is due to that Rustmission now asks specifically whether to delete a torrent with files or not.

# MULTIPLE SELECTIONS!

You can now press `Space` in torrents tab list in order to select multiple torrents. This is useful when you have to delete or move multiple torrents all at once.

# SORTING!

Just press `H` or `L` (that's a big H and L respectively) and see the magic happen

# CATEGORIES WITH DEFAULT DIRECTORIES!

Just define one in your `~/.config/rustmission/categories.toml` (which will be automatically generated with some commented-out examples) like this:

```toml
[[categories]]
icon = "[M]"
default_dir = "/mnt/Music/Classical"
color = "Green"
```

Whenever you'll be adding a new torrent, Rustmission will ask you for a category and its directory will be set to the category's default:

If you want to, you can set a category for an already existing torrent using `c`:

Autocompletion works so you can press TAB/CTRL-F/right and it will auto-complete!  
`TOOD:` after pressing enter this damn program should ask me whether to move this torrent to the category's default dir or not, but it's not doing that

# YOU CAN NOW SEARCH NYAA.SI FOR MAGNETS!

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91e9f14d-991f-4c61-a9c3-3ff5887bdac8)

Also improvements to the code were made so that new search providers can be added more easily. Though the `magnetease` crate still needs some polish.

# YOU CAN NOW OPEN TORRENTS DIRECTLY WITH XDG-OPEN

In the image shown, in files popup you can now press `o` in order to open selected file in your default application. You can press `o` within just the torrents tab and it will open currently highlighted torrent's directory.

# Icons are now configurable

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1cac8aa1-403d-465e-938e-c9df04e81618)

You can now replace these pesky nerd fonts icons if you don't have nerd fonts installed.
You can configure them at `.config/rustmission/config.toml` under `[icons]` section.
Use `rustmission print-default-config` to see the defaults.

# New details popup!
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a9565dc-5c07-4fca-be72-1e6015d23a97)

You can now press `Enter` while highlighting a torrent in torrents tab to view details about it (together with some useful hotkeys).

# Torrent errors are now being shown!

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ad34e07-1feb-4406-9890-0d38e377923c)

That was actually very easy to do thanks to Ratatui (the TUI library that Rustmission uses).

# Graphs in statistics!

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c27fc0e6-b9e3-4a26-aa3f-a99cf2e42c54)

Statistics popup isn't now as empty as before.

# Help popup is now much prettier!

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d93bdf7-341f-4e86-9048-8023a05c083b)

And also its text shouldn't take so much vertical space as it did before

# Default config printing

You can now type `rustmission print-default-config` or `rustmission print-default-keymap` in order to view the default config/keymap that is up to date.

# Other changes

There have been also performance improvements related to torrents filtering and action handling so Rustmission takes less CPU cycles for itself than it did before.
